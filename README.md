# Vietnamese answer sheet scoring framework

This is a small code for an assignment of CS309 course. The assignment is a computer vision task in which I create a scoring function to identify the circled answers on the sheet.

## How to run

Either upload this code to Google Colab or have Jupyter notebook kernal installed locally. Then, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the required libraries. Note that you must be careful of the torch library, as it depends on the Cuda version that is compatible with your GPUs.
